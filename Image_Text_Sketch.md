Sketch 5: Text & Image

Collage and Manipulation

Study chapters P3 & P4 in the Generative Design textbook. Using *text and image*, create a generative collage. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, generative means **_having the power or function of generating, originating, producing, or reproducing_**.

This collage should change over time, by user input or animation. This collage could be an interactive narrative or stop motion piece that tells a story. It could be an algorithmic poem that displays on the screen over time. Be creative and experimental with this exercise.

Be expressive. You don't have to be literal. You are _invited_ to be abstract.

 You must use images. Do not use sound. You may use graphics, but you are to mainly use images  and to manipulate and choreograph those manipulations over time.


Requirements:

- maniuplation of time
- animation
- movement
- images
- Play with: location, color, pixels, presence, absence
