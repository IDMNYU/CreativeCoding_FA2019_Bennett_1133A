## Sketch 1 Creature

#### Due Sept 12 
			
Come to class on Sept 12 with code that does the following:

Write a program that creates a creature. Use 5 different colors and 7 different shapes (MINIMUM). Can you do more? Can you stylize your creature? How can you make them interesting and noteable? How is their personality visually evident? We need to be able to look at your monster and to distinguish 2 personality traits. 

Get creative and have fun!

The more, the better. Are they located in a space, environment or landscape?

One way to interpret this is to think of different emotions that can be visually evident with multiple changes of the graphics. (not just one change, but multiple)

Use different shapes, colors, opacities, sizes, position, etc.

To isolate particular emotions or scenes, organize your code with comments (regarding what the code does) and group it with similar or related code. Then, be able to turn certain lines of code "on" or "off" via comment/uncomment.
