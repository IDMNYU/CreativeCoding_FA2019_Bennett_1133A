## Sketch 4 - Vectors 

#### Due Oct 25th 17:00

1. Take one of your previous Processing sketches, port it to P5, and add vectors to it to creation motion. You could do this by taking a graphic from a previous sketch or even someone else's sketch. Make it into a class. That class should have vectors for loction, velocity, and acceleration. That class should also have methods that display the graphic, another method to update the variables, and possibly another to check if it's off screen. 

Your update method should only deal with updating your variables for acceleration, velocity and location. You should be doing some vector math in there - adding vectors, subtracting vectors, multiplication, limit, etc.

Do not just directly and sololy copy Shiffman's code. Manipulate and craft this into your own code.

2. Then make the graphics move. 

3. Add greater control and sophistication of the movement. Do certain conditions change the vectors passed to the graphics? Are these conditions limited? Are they restored at times? Do other conditions manipulate these vectors in other ways?


Bonus:

- create multiple objects with different velocities and accelerations. Store them in an array.

- Have these objects move towards different goals: the mouse, a particular graphic/monster, etc.

- Work with forces
