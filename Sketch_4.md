## Sketch 3

### P5.js transition + Functions with parameters

#### Due Oct 3 before class fully begins. Both names need to be on the top of the code. Otherwise, credit will be given to neither student.

Working with a partner:

 1.) Take one of your first sketches - your creature - and translate it to the P5.js platform. Make sure that it functions in the browser properly!

 2.) Organize your monster into functions, utlizing variables AND PASSING PARAMETERS to those functions. 

 Matrix transformations can be quite handy here. Use variables for the x and y positions that are passed with the function call. Doing so will enable you to have multiples on the screen in varying locations.


 3.) Further organize those functions, into requiring variables for particular aspects that you wish to vary - width, height, color, variety, etc etc. Pass these variables as parameters and use them within the functions.


 4.) Create 3 different creatures. These different creatures should be quite and visably different from each other. This is achieved by reusing your functions and passing different parameters to those functions.

 Think: Mr/Ms Potato head. How can you use the functions for different body parts, to create multiple body parts in different areas of the body?

 There should be similarities and differences between them. This should be not only in how they look, but how they move and behave.


 **Bonus:** Create an array that stores different values for one variable. Ex. hair colors, # of appendages, # of eyes, etc. Use a for-loop to iterate through the array, passing the array's indice to a monster function call as a parameter.
