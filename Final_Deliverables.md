### Final Deliverables

# Self Assessment

Using Word or another text editor, reflect on the following: 

• ***Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result.***

• ***Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.***

• ***Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming.***


• ***Specifically considering your final project: What programming concepts solidified in your final project? What did you learn with reference to programming? Did you have a break through?***

• ***Specifically considering your final project: Were you able to resolve your own bugs? What tricks did you learn in the process to help? Did you do any debugging?*** 

• ***How do you think you'll move forward with programming? will you keep doing it ? How does this relate to other classes you are either taking or wish to take?*** 



# Also do each of the following:

• Take several screen shots of application running. Infact, [shoot a short video of the screen](https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/record-your-macs-screen-for-free-using-quicktime-0166773/). Get good, crisp, well lit, clear shots.

• copy and pasted 2-3 screen shots of code into Sublime that you are most proud of.

• concept paragraph answering the following: What is your piece about? What's the concept? Is it interactive, responsive or time based?, name of piece

• Direct message me the above documents and post them to your github repo for the final project.
