## Project 1 - The Unexpected Machine: Procedural Intensity/Change

**Due Oct 10 --> In class critiques**

**20% of your final grade**

Weekly pushes and development are expected

Pick an adjective and make a program that illustrates that adjective interactively. You may not use images.  Only drawing functions, meaning mostly stuff found in the ‘graphics’ section.

Start with a small, very simple shape.

The goal of this assignment is to explore, experiment and to ideate. As a result, you don't have to know the outcome from when you start. But you must demonstrate a rigerous investigation, with exploration, experimentation and ideation.

You are to explore this adjective, and to transcribe it's meaning, through mark making via procedural graphics. Think about the energy your adjective describes. How can you translate that to movement with this small shape? How does that movement change over time? In addtion to movement, explore color, size, opacity, etc. What happens after a collection of them are drawn? Can you create patterns and textures that describe this adjective?

After experiencing the duration of your piece, we will guess your adjective. As such, think of this as a performance: You have the entire performance to use to help transcribe your adjective. Think about building, drama and events.

Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Make sure to read Learning Processing Chapters 13 + 14, as well as the Generative Design Text.

Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement?

### Ingredients: <br>

• Graphics (shape, color, line, placement, custom shapes) <br>
• Control Structures (if, for, while) <br>
• Movement <br>
• Interaction (mouse, keyboard)<br>
• Custom functions with passing parameters<br>
• Arrays<br>
• Math <br>
• Random <br>

###Must haves: 
<br>
	• heavy use of variables<br>
	• custom functions passing variables as parameter <br>
	• loops <br>
	• control structures <br>
	• math or random <br>
	• some use of interaction or change over time <br>
	• movement, change, variety <br>
	• arrays <br>
	• conditionals <br>
	• OOP - with methods + passing parameters <br>

	
To give you an idea of how much development I'm looking for, your code should be beyond 100 lines of code, which incorporates the concepts we've learned thus far. Spacing, comments or commented out code are not counted as lines.

Weekly pushes to your **GitHub Repo are required**
