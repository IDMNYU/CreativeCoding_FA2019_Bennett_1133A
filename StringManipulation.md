Sketch 5 Possibility: String Manipulations - Data Visualizations or Algorithmic Poems


1. take a story from [GutenBerg](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/en)

2. Look over the data.... What would you like to pull out of it? Do you want to look for the number of times a particular word appears? Pull out every 3 word of a sentence? Do you want to combine words? Create new arrangements of words? Subtract or replace particular words?

This will be the data you use to generate a new piece, poem, data visualization, etc.

3. Create the code to find those data points and to "do it's thing."

4. Visualize your data in some interesting way. Have the output appear algorithmically. Be thoughtful in this endeavour. Play with timing, location, appearance, font, size, color, existence, animation,  procedural aspects or interactivity
