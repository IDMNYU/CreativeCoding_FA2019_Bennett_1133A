### Sketch 2

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern

#### Due Sept 19 8AM sharp
        

 Using 1 form/shape and create 5 DRASTICALLY different grid-like patterns. Start with creating one grid. Then in subsequent (and different patterns), manipulate that grid so that it is less grid-like. How can you start to deviate from a grid? Can you skip every other one? etc. Variables, loops, and exit conditions are your key.

 Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in ONE sketch

 - use active mode
 - use variables
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique, and to have variety
