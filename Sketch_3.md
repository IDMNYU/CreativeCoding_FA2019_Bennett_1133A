### Sketch 3

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern Part II

#### Due Sept 26 8 AM Sharp

Using a pattern created in sketch 2, how can you use it as a drawing tool/instrument? What if it that pattern was one bristle on a brush? What if three bristles touched the canvas?

The goal is to create multiple patterns, on one input. How can each pattern have a unique location on the screen, so that they are not all drawn on top of each other?

Matrix transformations, variables, loops and rotation are your keys.

Use your variables to parameterize and control this brush. Focus on one structure of code. By manipulaing your variables, you can control, diversify, and manipulate your design.

Can you send it values to animate it across the screen based upon an input? Can you create a loop, which creates your pattern? Can you then trigger that loop upon input? Can this sequence of events take in data, to make it slightly different over time? 

Can you then create different brushes, each with a unique form/pattern. How many iterations of your pattern occur with one click or mouse movement?

How does the size change? How does the space between the marks change? Can you make a spray can pattern? Does something happen to the mark once it's on the page? Does it bleed, spread, or blend with other colors on the page once it's there?

 - How could you incorporate random and/or interactivity to add variety + change? How could this be controlled over time?

 - Use your matrix transformations and for-loops
